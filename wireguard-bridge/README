How to configure:
	Copy the following files to ./wireguard/wg-configs/:
		- nezha-prod.conf
		- nezha-testnet.conf
		- nezha-staging.conf

How to run:
	Run `just start`

How it works:
	If you go to any of:
		- nezha-staging.localhost
		- nezha-testnet.localhost
		- nezha-testnet2.localhost
		- nezha-prod.localhost
	the request will go to caddy listening on *:80 on localhost.
	We are using (https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) to auto-configure the caddy
	server so that it routes these hostnames to different containers.

	There are 1 container each for the above URLs.
	Inside each of them, it is connected to the respective wireguard server.
	Each of them also have a caddy server that forwards all requests to localhost:80 to lottery.internal.service:80.
	

Basically:

	[Browser] --> [Top Level Caddy] --> [Container | [Caddy] --> [Wireguard] --> [GraphQL]]

 (auto configured using docker-caddy-proxy)
